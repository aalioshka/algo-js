# üèéÔ∏è 1. Memoization Strategies

* `React.memo()`
  * Prevent re-renders of pure functional components
* `useMemo()`
  * Cache expensive computations
* `useCallback()`
  * Cache functions so they‚Äôre not re-created on each render

### ‚úÖ Example: `React.memo()` in a List

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è The React team (notably Dan Abramov) advises: ‚ÄúMeasure before you memo.‚Äù Use `React.memo()` only when you‚Äôve profiled and confirmed it improves performance.

#### ‚úÖ When to use React.memo()

* Component is pure (its output depends only on props)
* Component is re-rendering frequently with the same props
* Component has non-trivial render cost (e.g. heavy computation, large lists, complex DOM)

#### ‚ùå When to avoid it

* If the component is small, fast, or doesn‚Äôt re-render often ‚Äî memoization adds comparison overhead.
* If props are changing every time (e.g. new function/object instances), React.memo() gives no benefit.


## ‚úÖ Example: `React.memo()` in a List

Let‚Äôs say you have a list of todo items. Only one item is marked complete at a time ‚Äî but all children re-render unnecessarily:

#### Without `React.memo()`:

```tsx
function TodoItem({ todo, onToggle }) {
  console.log('Rendering', todo.text);
  return (
    <li onClick={() => onToggle(todo.id)}>
      {todo.completed ? '‚úÖ' : '‚¨ú'} {todo.text}
    </li>
  );
}
```
* All items re-render when any item toggles, even if their props didn‚Äôt change.

#### ‚úÖ Optimized with` React.memo()`:

```tsx
const TodoItem = React.memo(function TodoItem({ todo, onToggle }) {
  console.log('Rendering', todo.text);
  return (
    <li onClick={() => onToggle(todo.id)}>
      {todo.completed ? '‚úÖ' : '‚¨ú'} {todo.text}
    </li>
  );
});
```

* Now each <TodoItem /> only re-renders when its own todo prop or onToggle function reference changes.
* üìå To make this even more effective, pair with useCallback so onToggle doesn‚Äôt change unnecessarily.

### ‚úÖ Example for `useMemo()` and `useCallback()`

```tsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(input), [input]);
const memoizedHandler = useCallback(() => handleSomething(id), [id]);
```

# üîÅ 2. React Rendering Behavior

**Core concepts**:
* **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight JS representation of the DOM
* **Reconciliation**: React‚Äôs process to diff old vs new VDOM trees and update only what's changed
* **Re-renders**: Triggered by:
  * `setState` or `useState/useReducer` updates
  * Props changes
  * Context value changes
* üî• **Common performance pitfall**: Passing new functions or objects into deeply nested components triggers unnecessary re-renders.

**Strategy**:
* Break components down to isolate re-renders
* Use `React.memo` or `useMemo` where appropriate
* Use stable references with `useCallback`

# ‚è≥ 3. Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

Reduces **initial JS bundle size**, improving **Time to Interactive**.

* **Tools**:
  * `React.lazy` and `Suspense`
  * Dynamic `import()`

  #### Example

```tsx
const SettingsPanel = React.lazy(() => import('./SettingsPanel'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
      <SettingsPanel />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

#### Other ideas:
* Bundle splitting with **Webpack**
* Route-based code splitting (common with **React Router**)
* Image lazy loading, font preloading

# üß™ 4. Profiling a Slow React App

### üí¨ Interview Question:

"Have you ever profiled a slow React app? What tools did you use and how did you improve performance?"

### ‚úÖ Strong Answer:

* Yes ‚Äî I worked on a dashboard app where scrolling and typing became sluggish.
* FIrst, I used:
  * **React DevTools Profiler** to visualize which components re-render frequently
  * **Chrome DevTools Performance tab** to check paint, layout, and scripting costs
* Findings:
  * An expensive computation was re-running on every render
  * A large list was re-rendering entirely instead of just visible items
Solutions:
* Used `useMemo()` for the expensive calculation
* Applied `React.memo()` on list items
* Switched to `react-window` for virtualization

# üß† Performance Optimization Summary

| Concept | Practice |
|---------|----------|
| Memoization | `useMemo` for values, `useCallback` for handlers, `React.memo` for components |
| React Rendering | Understand triggers and isolate updates with memoization |
| Lazy Loading | Use `React.lazy`, dynamic imports, and `Suspense` to split bundles |
| Profiling | Use React DevTools + Chrome Profiler to spot unnecessary re-renders |

## üîß What is react-window?

* `react-window` is a lightweight library by Brian Vaughn (a member of the React core team) that efficiently renders large lists and tabular data by virtualizing them ‚Äî meaning it only renders the visible portion of the list (plus a small buffer), rather than the entire list in the DOM.
* This drastically improves performance in React apps where lists may contain hundreds or thousands of items.

## üöÄ Why Use react-window?

#### Rendering large lists in React can cause:
* High memory usage
* Long scripting/paint/layout time in Chrome DevTools
* UI sluggishness (laggy scroll or input)
#### Virtualization solves this by rendering only what the user sees.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

#### `react-window` takes in:
* `height` / `width` of the container
* `itemCount` ‚Äî total number of list items
* `itemSize` ‚Äî height or width of each item (depending on orientation)
* `children` ‚Äî a function to render each item
#### It then calculates which items are visible and only renders those.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Example

```tsx
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const MyList = ({ items }) => (
  <List
    height={400}           // total height of the scrollable container
    itemCount={items.length}
    itemSize={35}          // height of each row
    width="100%"
  >
    {({ index, style }) => (
      <div style={style}>
        {items[index]}
      </div>
    )}
  </List>
);

```

#### NOTE

*  When you use a regular list in React, you might write:

```tsx
items.map((item, index) => <div key={index}>{item}</div>)
```

* But with react-window, you don‚Äôt use .map() at all.

#### Instead, you give it:
* The total number of items (itemCount)
* A function that tells it how to render a single item at a given index
* That‚Äôs why this part is enough ‚Äî it's telling `react-window` how to render one item, and the library handles the rest.
```tsx
{({ index, style }) => (
  <div style={style}>
    {items[index]}
  </div>
)}

```

# üß† So so performance fix:

```bash
"We originally rendered the list with .map(), 
which caused performance issues with large datasets. 
I replaced that with react-window, 
which avoids .map() entirely 
and instead takes a render function 
that gets called only for visible items. 
That cut our DOM nodes dramatically 
and improved scroll performance immediately."
```
