# 🔁 1. Custom Hooks

* **What it is:** A function prefixed with use that encapsulates reusable hook logic.
* **Why use them**:
  * Avoid duplication
  * Keep components clean and focused
  * Share side effects/state logic between components

## 💬 Interview Question:

"Walk me through a custom hook you wrote. Why did you build it as a hook instead of a component?"

## ✅ Strong Answer:

* I built a useDebouncedValue hook to debounce inputs like search queries. I chose a hook over a component because it’s **purely logic-based**, with **no UI**, and I wanted to reuse it across different input components.

```tsx
// useDebouncedValue.ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useDebouncedValue<T>(value: T, delay: number) {
  const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(value), delay);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debounced;
}

```

```ts
// Example usage
const searchTerm = useDebouncedValue(inputValue, 300);
```

* I avoided making it a component because there’s no markup or lifecycle concern outside of state timing — this is exactly what hooks are best at.

# 🔄 2. Complex State Logic with `useReducer`
* Why use it:
  *  Multiple related state values
  * Complex state transitions (e.g., undo/redo, form wizard)
  * Easily testable and maintainable

## 💬 Interview Question:

"When would you prefer `useReducer` over `useState`?"

## ✅ Answer:

I reach for `useReducer` when:
* State updates depend on the previous state
* There are multiple pieces of related state
* I want a more declarative or Redux-like update pattern

```tsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

// keep in component just to show case, but it will be its own file
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement': return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default: return state;
  }
}

export function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}> - </button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}> + </button>
      <div>Count: {state.count}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* This pattern scales well and helps keep logic out of the component body.

# 🚀 3. Performance: useMemo & useCallback

* `useMemo(fn, deps)`:
  * Memoizes `expensive computations`
  * Only recomputes if dependencies change
* `useCallback(fn, deps)`
  * Memoizes a function
  * Prevents unnecessary re-renders or effect re-triggers

## 💬 Interview Question:

"Give an example where `useMemo` helped performance in your app."

## ✅ Strong Answer:

* I had a component that rendered a large filtered list. Filtering the list was expensive, and it ran on every keystroke.
* Wrapping the filter logic in `useMemo` ensured it only re-ran when the list or query changed:

```tsx
const filteredItems = useMemo(
  () => items.filter(item => item.label.includes(searchTerm)),
  [items, searchTerm]
);
```
* This reduced lag and unnecessary work, especially for thousands of items.

## 💬 Interview Question:

* "When would you use useCallback?"

## ✅ Strong Answer:

When I pass a function to a child component or dependency array, I use `useCallback` to memoize it. This prevents re-renders in memoized children or infinite loops in `useEffect`.* 

```tsx
import React, {useState, useCallback} from 'react'
export function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const decrease = useCallback(() => setCount(count => count - 1), [])
  const increase = useCallback(() => setCount(count => count + 1), [])
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrease}>-</button>
      <button onClick={increase}>+</button>
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

# 🧠 Hooks Mastery Summary

| Hook | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `useDebouncedValue` (Custom Hook) | Extract logic like debouncing, polling, auth checks, or localStorage sync |
| `useReducer`                 | Complex logic: multiple state pieces, actions, or transitions |
| `useMemo`                    | Optimize expensive calculations (e.g. filtering, derived values) |
| `useCallback`                | Memoize functions passed to children or hooks |

# 📦 HOC vs Hooks

### 🔁 What is a Higher-Order Component? (Depricated, old Class based legacy)

A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component.

```tsx
const withAuth = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    const isLoggedIn = useAuth(); // Assume a custom hook
    if (!isLoggedIn) {
      return <Navigate to="/login" />;
    }
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
};

const Dashboard = () => <div>Welcome to your dashboard</div>;
export default withAuth(Dashboard);
```

### 🔄 Comparison: HOC vs Custom Hook

| Feature | HOC | Custom Hook |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Applies to** | Class or function components | Only function components |
| **Syntax** | Wraps a component | Called inside a component |
| **Popularity in 2025**| Legacy/Advanced use cases | Preferred default pattern |

### ✅ What We Use in Modern React

In modern React, we mostly use custom hooks and the Context API to share logic and manage global state. HOCs are rarely needed anymore except for legacy class components or UI wrappers. Custom hooks give us clearer, more maintainable, and composable code, which fits well with the function component model React encourages today.
