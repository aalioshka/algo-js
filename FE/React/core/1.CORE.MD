# üîÅ 1. React Lifecycle (and Functional Equivalents)

* In class components:
  * `componentDidMount ‚Üí useEffect(() => {...}, [])`
  * `componentDidUpdate ‚Üí useEffect(() => {...}, [dep])`
  * `componentWillUnmount ‚Üí useEffect(() => return () => {...}, [])`

*  In function components, `useEffect` runs **after**` the DOM is painted, while useLayoutEffect` runs **synchronously after render but before the browser paints**.

## üí¨ Interview Question:

‚ÄúWhen would you use useLayoutEffect over useEffect? Can you give a concrete use case?‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Good Answer (with example):

* I'd use `useLayoutEffect` when I need to **measure the DOM or make visual changes before the browser paints** to avoid flickering or layout shift.

* For example, if I need to measure an element‚Äôs width and then apply a style or scroll position based on it, useLayoutEffect ensures the DOM is ready before painting.

```js
import { useLayoutEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

function AutoResizeText() {
  const textRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (textRef.current) {
      setWidth(textRef.current.offsetWidth);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={textRef}>Resizable text</div>
      <p>Measured width: {width}px</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```

* If I had used `useEffect` here, the browser might paint the DOM before the measurement, causing a visible flicker. That's why `useLayoutEffect` is the right choice in this scenario.

# ‚úÖ 2. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

## Controlled:
* React controls the value via state
* More predictable, good for validation and business logic

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState('');
<input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
```

## Uncontrolled:
* Uses DOM state, React doesn‚Äôt control it
* Easier for simple cases or forms with no dynamic behavior

```tsx
<input defaultValue="Hello" ref={inputRef} />
```

## üí¨ Interview Question:

"What are the trade-offs between controlled and uncontrolled components?"

## ‚úÖ Answer:

* Controlled components give you full control and make things like validation, conditional rendering, or syncing state across components easier.

* Uncontrolled components are simpler to write and may perform better for very large forms, but they don‚Äôt allow tight control or centralized validation logic.

# 3. Lifting State Up

**When two or more components need shared state**, lift it to their nearest common parent.

```tsx
function Parent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <Input value={value} onChange={setValue} />
      <Display value={value} />
    </>
  );
}

function Input({ value, onChange }) {
  return <input value={value} onChange={e => onChange(e.target.value)} />;
}

function Display({ value }) {
  return <p>{value}</p>;
}

```

## üí¨ Interview Question:

"How do you handle two components needing access to the same state?"

## ‚úÖ Answer:

* I lift the shared state to their common parent so that the data flows top-down through props, ensuring a single source of truth and React's unidirectional data flow.


# ‚öñÔ∏è 4. Props vs State: Separation of Concerns
* `State` is local and `owned` by the component.
* `Props` are `passed in` from the parent and should be treated as immutable.

## üí¨ Interview Question:

‚ÄúHow do you decide whether something should be stored in state or passed as a prop?‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Answer:
 * If a component owns and modifies the data, it should use state.
 * If it just receives the data to display or act on, it should use props.
 * This helps isolate logic and makes components reusable and testable.

| `useEffect` vs `useLayoutEffect` | Use `useLayoutEffect` when you must **read/modify layout before paint** to prevent flicker or layout shift |
| Controlled vs Uncontrolled       | **Controlled** = React owns the state; **Uncontrolled** = DOM manages it via refs or default values        |
| Lifting State Up                 | Move shared state to the **nearest common ancestor** to ensure a single source of truth                    |
| Props vs State                   | **Props** = read-only inputs from parent; **State** = local, mutable data owned by the component           |
