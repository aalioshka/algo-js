In a Technical Expertise Interview with a React.js expert, you can expect the conversation to go beyond basic knowledge and dive into intermediate-to-advanced React topics, especially those that test real-world problem solving, architectural decisions, performance optimization, and team-level impact.

## 1. Core React Knowledge (expected to be strong)
* React lifecycle (including functional component equivalents like useEffect)
* Controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Lifting state up
* Props/state separation of concerns
* Example question:
  * "When would you use useLayoutEffect over useEffect? Can you give a concrete use case?"

See detailed break down [here](1.CORE.MD)

## 2. Hooks Mastery
* Custom hooks (abstraction, reusability)
* Complex state logic with useReducer
* Performance with useMemo, useCallback
* Example question:
  * "Walk me through a custom hook you wrote. Why did you build it as a hook instead of a component?"

See detailed break down [here](2.Hooks.MD)

## 3. Component Architecture
* Component decomposition
* Presentational vs container components
* Design system integration
* Co-locating state logic and UI logic
* Example question:
  * "How do you structure components in a large React codebase to make it scalable and maintainable?"

See detailed break down [here](3.Component-Architecture.MD)

## 4. State Management (local and global)
* Context API vs Redux vs Recoil/Zustand
* Prop drilling and how to avoid it
* Async state handling with useEffect, useSWR, React Query, etc.
* Example question:
  * "Why might you choose React Context over Redux in a new project? What trade-offs are you making?"

See detailed break down [here](4.State-Management.MD)

## 5. Performance Optimization
* Memoization strategies
* React rendering behavior (virtual DOM, reconciliation)
* Lazy loading, code splitting
* Example question:
  * "Have you ever profiled a slow React app? What tools did you use and how did you improve performance?"

## 6. Testing React Applications
* Unit tests (Jest, Testing Library)
* Testing hooks, mocking APIs, user interactions
* Integration and E2E considerations
* Example question:
  * "How do you test a hook that uses useEffect to fetch data? Can you walk through your approach?"

## 7. React with TypeScript
* Typing props, state, and custom hooks
* Using generics with hooks
* Type safety in large codebases
* Example question:
  * "How would you type a useForm custom hook that handles multiple form fields dynamically?"

## 8. Code Review and Collaboration Skills
* Evaluating code quality and scalability
* Mentoring juniors on React best practices
* Communicating architectural trade-offs
* Example question:
  * "You notice a teammate is overusing useEffect for things that can be done in event handlers. How would you approach this?"

## 9. React Ecosystem Awareness
* Familiarity with libraries like:
  * Next.js (routing, SSR)
  * React Query / SWR
  * Storybook
  * Tailwind, Styled Components

## 10. Recent React Trends
* Concurrent rendering
* Server Components
* Suspense for data fetching
* React Server Components in Next.js 14
* Example question:
  * "What are React Server Components, and how do they differ from SSR?"
