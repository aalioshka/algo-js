# ðŸ§± 1. Component Decomposition

**Goal**: Break large components into **smaller**, **reusable**, single-responsibility units.

## Pattern:

* Large feature âžœ split into:
  * Container (logic)
  * Presentational (UI)
  * Small atomic components (buttons, cards)

## ðŸ§  Heuristics:
* If a component does too many things, break it up
* Reuse a behavior in 2+ places? Extract a hook or component
* Prefer composition over props explosion

## ðŸ’¬ Interview Question:

"How do you structure components in a large React codebase to make it scalable and maintainable?"

## âœ… Strong Answer:

* I follow a pattern of decomposing features into layers:
  * **Container components**: Handle data fetching, state management, and hooks.
  * **Presentational components**: Stateless UI-only components.
  * *Atomic components**: Inputs, buttons, icons from a design system.
* I keep related files co-located by feature (not type), following a folder-by-feature structure. This keeps code intuitive and minimizes cross-module imports.

### ðŸ§± Example:

```bash
/features/
  search/
    SearchContainer.tsx
    SearchInput.tsx
    SearchResults.tsx
    useSearch.ts
```
* `SearchContainer` handles the query state and debouncing
* `SearchInput` is purely presentational (input + onChange)
* `SearchResults` renders UI
* `useSearch` encapsulates data fetching logic

# ðŸŽ¨ 2. Presentational vs Container Components

| Type           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Presentational | Receives props, renders UI only |
| Container | Owns state, business logic, side effects |

### Example:

```tsx
// Presentational
function SearchInput({ value, onChange }) {
  return <input value={value} onChange={onChange} />;
}

// Container
function SearchContainer() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  return <SearchInput value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

# ðŸŽ¯ 3. Design System Integration

* Use a design system to:
  * Maintain visual consistency
  * Speed up development
  * Simplify handoff with designers

* Example tools:
  * Internal component library
  * Libraries like Radix, shadcn/ui, Chakra, or MUI

### ðŸ’¬ Interview Tip:

'I prefer using a design system for all base components (buttons, modals, inputs) and layering business-specific logic on top. This gives consistency and avoids reinventing UI logic.'

# ðŸ§© 4. Co-locating State and UI Logic

* Donâ€™t scatter logic across files unless there's a reason.

### Example:

* Keep state, event handlers, and the UI they affect in the same file if theyâ€™re tightly coupled. Extract only when needed for reuse or clarity.

```tsx
function ModalWithToggle() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open</button>
      {open && <Modal onClose={() => setOpen(false)} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

* This improves readability and traceability, especially for new developers.

# ðŸ§  Summary Table

| Concept                     | Key Practice |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Component Decomposition     | Break down into container, presentational, and atomic components |
| Presentational vs Container | Separate logic (container) from UI (presentational) |
| Design System Integration   | Use standardized UI components for consistency and speed |
| Co-locating State and UI Logic | Keep logic near its UI unless thereâ€™s a clear benefit to separate |
